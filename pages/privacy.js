        </ul>
        <h4 className='text-gray-50'>Types of information we collect</h4>
        <p>The types of information we collect include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Personal and business contact information (such as name, business

        </ul>
        <h4 className='text-gray-50'>Information We Collect from or on Behalf of Our Clients</h4>
        <p>
          We may collect information about individual consumers from our clients
          or – at clients' request– from their service providers. Our clients
          determine the scope of the information transferred to us, and the
          information we receive may vary by client. Typically, we may collect
          clients' consumers' contact details and demographic data, shopping
          histories, and details about consumers' interactions with marketing
          communications.
        </p>
        <h3 className='text-gray-50'>COOKIES AND OTHER INFORMATION COLLECTED BY AUTOMATED MEANS</h3>
        <p>
          We, our service providers, and our business partners, may collect
          certain information about the use of our websites by automated means,
          such as cookies, web beacons and other technologies. Likewise, as part
          of our services, we may offer our clients the ability to install these
          types of technologies on their websites or in the emails they send to
          their customers; and if a client does so, we collect information on its
          behalf. A &quot;cookie&quot; is a text file that websites send to a visitor's
          computer or other Internet-connected device to uniquely identify the
          visitor's browser or to store information or settings in the browser. A
          &quot;web beacon,&quot; also known as an Internet tag, pixel tag or clear GIF, is
          used to transmit information back to a web server. We and our service
          providers and business partners may collect information about your
          online activities over time and across third-party websites when you use
          our websites and mobile applications.
        </p>
        <p>
          Because there is not yet a consensus on how companies should respond to
          web browser-based do-not-track (&quot;DNT&quot;) mechanisms, we do not respond to
          web browser-based DNT signals at this time. Please see the &quot;Privacy
          Preferences, Rights and Choices&quot; section below for information about how
          you may opt out of, or limit the use of, your browsing behavior for
          online behavioral advertising purposes.
        </p>
        <p>
          The information we collect by automated means varies based on whether we
          are collecting information for our own business purposes or whether we
          are collecting information from or on behalf of our customers to provide
          our services.
