              GENERAL PROVISIONS.
              <ol type='A'>
                <li>
                  Sponsor reserves the right to cancel,
                  suspend and/or modify any Giveaway, or any
                  part of it, if any fraud, computer bugs,
                  computer viruses, hacking, security breach,
                  tampering, technical failures, human error,
                  service interruptions, force majeure or any
                  other factor impairs the integrity or proper
                  functioning of the Giveaway, as determined
                  by Sponsor in its sole and absolute
                  discretion. In such event, Sponsor, in its
                  sole and absolute discretion, may elect to
                  hold a random drawing from among all
                  eligible entries received up to the date of
                  discontinuance for any or all of the prizes
                  offered in the Giveaway. Sponsor reserves
                  the right, in its sole and absolute
                  discretion, to disqualify any individual it
                  finds to be abusing or tampering with the
                  entry process or the operation of the
                  Giveaway or to be acting in violation of the
                  Official Rules of this or any other
                  promotion or in an unsportsmanlike,
                  fraudulent, deceptive, or disruptive manner.
                  Any attempt by any person to deliberately
                  undermine the legitimate operation of the
                  Giveaway may be a violation of criminal and
                  civil law, and, should such an attempt be
                  made, Sponsor reserves the right to seek
                  damages from any such person to the fullest
                  extent permitted by law. Sponsor's failure
                  to enforce any term of these Official Rules
                  or any other additional rules on the
                  Giveaway Page shall not constitute a waiver
                  of that provision.
                </li>
                <li>

                  to be found in violation of these rules.

                  feature, or functionality offered thereon.
                  Sponsor shall not be responsible for any
                  damage caused to Participant's computer,
                  mobile device, or data, or for any bugs,

              human error which may occur in the administration of
              the Giveaway or the processing of entries; (5) late,
              lost, undeliverable, damaged or stolen mail; (6) any

                  otherwise, all claims arising out of the
                  Giveaway and all issues and matters

                  Process. Any claim, controversy, or dispute
                  (whether in contract, tort, or otherwise)
                  arising directly or indirectly out of or
                  related to the Giveaway shall be resolved
                  exclusively by a final and binding
                  arbitration administered by the American
                  Arbitration Association (the "AAA") and
                  conducted before a sole arbitrator pursuant
                  to the applicable Rules and Procedures
                  established by the AAA. This arbitration
                  agreement is made pursuant to a transaction
                  involving interstate commerce, and shall be
                  governed by the Federal Arbitration Act (the
                  "FAA"), 9 U.S.C. §§ 1-16. The arbitration
                  shall be conducted in the English language.
                  The arbitration shall be held at a location
                  determined by the AAA pursuant to the Rules
                  and Procedures (provided such location is
                  reasonably convenient for Participant), or
                  at such a location as may be mutually agreed
                  by the Participant and Sponsor. The
                  arbitrator's decision shall be controlled by
                  the terms and conditions of these Official
                  Rules, together with any other additional
                  rules on the Giveaway Page, and any of the
                  other agreements referenced herein that the
                  Participant may have entered into in
                  connection with the Giveaway. The arbitrator
                  shall apply the laws of the State of
                  Kansas consistent with the FAA and
                  applicable statutes of limitations, and
                  shall honor claims of privilege recognized
                  at law. To the extent permitted by law,
                  Participant agrees that under no
                  circumstances will the Participant be
                  permitted to obtain an award for, and
                  Participant hereby waives all rights to,
                  consequential, incidental, punitive damages,
                  or any other damages, and any and all rights
                  to have damages multiplied or otherwise
                  increased.

                  ANY ARBITRATIONS, DISPUTES, CLAIMS, AND
                  CAUSES OF ACTION THAT OCCUR WILL BE RESOLVED
                  ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS. CLASS ARBITRATIONS,

                  Scope. This agreement to arbitrate claims
                  and disputes is intended to be broad and
                  includes, without limitation, (i) claims or
                  disputes relating to any aspect of the
                  Giveaway, whether based in contract, tort,
                  statute, or any other legal theory, (ii)
                  claims or disputes directly or indirectly
                  arising from conduct or events that occurred
                  prior to the effective date of these Rules
                  (including, without limitation, claims
                  relating to advertising), or after its
                  termination, (iii) claims or disputes
                  subject to class action litigation in which
                  Participant is not currently a member of a
                  certified class, and (iv) claims or disputes
                  with any agent, employee, successor or
                  assign of Participant, the Sponsor, the
                  Administrator, or any Released Party (all
                  such claims and disputes are referred to
                  collectively as "Claims"). This agreement to
                  arbitrate does not, however, include Claims
                  pertaining to intellectual property rights.

                  No Preclusive Effect. No award or finding or
                  stipulation of fact by the arbitrator will
                  have any preclusive or collateral estoppel
                  effect in any other arbitration or court,
                  unless it involves the exact same parties.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Severability. If any part of this
                  arbitration provision is deemed to be
                  invalid, unenforceable or illegal, then the
                  balance of this arbitration provision shall
                  remain in effect and shall be construed in
                  accordance with its terms as if the invalid,
                  unenforceable or illegal provision were not
                  contained herein.

                  verification and prize delivery, any change,
                  modification, repeal of any existing law,

                  new laws, legislation, or regulations,
                  become effective that will make any prize
                  illegal, alter the winner verification
                  process, or effect the prize delivery,
                  Sponsor may distribute a cash prize for the
                  wholesale or dealer cost of the prize, as
                  determined by Sponsor.
